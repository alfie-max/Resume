\section{Projects}

\cvline{\textbf{Title}}{\emph{\textbf{Publish - Multichannel announcement application}}}
\cvline{\textbf{Description}}{\small{This project was developed as a part of the Lycaeum Mentoring course. Publish is a multichannel announcement python application. Using this application we can sent out messages to multiple channels at once. Currently Twitter, Facebook, Email and Blogging channels have been implemented.}}
\small{
\cvline{}{Languages : Python 2.7}
\cvline{}{Tools : Git, Emacs}
\cvline{}{Duration : 45 Days}
\cvline{}{Public APIs : facebook-sdk, tweepy, mechanize, Pillow, etc.}

\cvline{\textbf{Title}}{\emph{\textbf{Ultrasonic Hover Input Device}}}
\cvline{\textbf{Description}}{\small{This is an extension of the Project, Ultrasonic Based Hover Input Device. Objective of this project was to improve hardware performance and tracking precision so that a reliable working model can be made. Finally a working device which can recognize hand motions(left, right, up, down) was developed and demonstrated using windows GUI application. I was actively involved in requirements gathering, PCB design and windows application development of the project.}}
\small{
\cvline{}{Languages : C\#, Embedded C}
\cvline{}{Hardware : Atmega 328P MCU}
\cvline{}{IDE : Visual Studio 2013, Atmel Studio, Circuit Wizard}
\cvline{}{Duration : 2 months [ Main Project : 7$^{th}$ \& 8$^{th}$ Semester ]}
}

\cvline{\textbf{Title}}{\emph{\textbf{PC based Wireless Automatic Energy Meter Billing}}}
\cvline{\textbf{Description}}{\small{Using the PC based Automatic Wireless Energy Meter Billing system getting monthly readings and bill creation is automated for multiple consumers. In case of defaulters the connection is disconnected until payment is made. A GSM module is used for sending and receiving meter readings and bill created. Credit card based payment system has been implemented using RFID tags/reader. I was actively involved in the electricity board side PC application development which controls the overall working of the complete system.}}

\cvline{\textbf{Title}}{\emph{\textbf{Advanced Braille Note Taking System}}}
\cvline{\textbf{Description}}{\small{The Advanced Braille Note Taking System is a small portable device which contains 8 keys, 6 keys for entering the Braille characters and 2 navigation keys. The device is connected to a computer for permanent storing of data. Speech Synthesizer is used for text to speech conversion to assist the blind. Email service is also implemented. I was actively involved in the PC application development which does speech synthesis for assisting the blind and takes notes which is stored for later access.}}

\cvline{\textbf{Title}}{\emph{\textbf{Ultrasonic Based Hover Input Device}}}
\cvline{\textbf{Description}}{\small{In this project we have designed a device which can track hand movements in front of a computer screen using ultrasonic waves. The basic principle of trilateration was used for calculating the position of the hand. For fast calculation and producing the ultrasonic signals Atmega 328P micro-controller was used. Finally the information corresponding to the location of the hand is send to the PC. I was actively involved in requirements gathering, Circuit Design and PCB design.}}
